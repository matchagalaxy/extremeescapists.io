<h1> About Us:
  
</h1>
   <p>Extreme Escapes is a family-owned company that began in 1992, brought together by the joyful union of Sharon Parker and 
     Kendall Jones. The two had been fans of escape rooms since their childhood, and had often gone on roadtrips to other states
     just to visit new and exciting experiences. One day, while browsing the web to search for new escape rooms, Sharon had an Eureka moment.
     "Why isn't there a website dedicated to cataloguing all sorts of different escape rooms?" she thought.
     With just an idea in her mind and $20, she registered a site from GoDaddy and together with her husband began the multi-million dollar business of 
     categorizing escape rooms. Nowadays, Sharon and Kendall enjoy a peaceful life in Nevada with their three kids, two dogs, and four cats.
     Sharon's other hobbies include tennis, football, and fly fishing. Kendall enjoys sleeping in on the weekends and walking the dog.
